  <h1>It dances in the stillness.</h1>
  <p>Exists between two nothings.</p>
  <p>The infant’s first cry, the elder’s last sigh—</p>
  <p>Yet you never hold it, never see it, never end it.</p>
  <p>It is not thought, not flesh, but what lies between.</p>
  <p>It is not you, but without it, you are not.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p><strong>What breathes without lungs?</strong></p>
